## 🛣️ PROJECT ROADMAP — EXCEL DASHBOARD IN REACT

---

### 🧱 1. **Project Setup**

* Set up a new React app (with Vite or CRA)
* Install required libraries:

  * `exceljs` – to parse `.xlsx` Excel files
  * `recharts` or `chart.js` – to visualize data
  * `html2canvas` + `jspdf` – for PDF download
  * (Optional) Tailwind or other CSS lib for styling

---

### 📤 2. **File Upload System**

* Add an `<input type="file" />` to allow users to upload `.xlsx` files
* Read the uploaded file using `xlsx`
* Parse all relevant sheets into usable JSON

✅ **Goal**: At this stage, log the cleaned JSON to the console.

---

### 🧹 3. **Data Cleaning & Normalization**

* Standardize sheet formats (some rows may be time, others may be NaN)
* Extract:

  * Parameter names (like "Casting I")
  * Dates as X-axis
  * Values per day per parameter
* Store data in a format like:

```js
[
  {
    name: "Casting I",
    data: [ { date: '2025-04-01', value: 83300 }, ... ]
  },
  ...
]
```

✅ **Goal**: Unified format across months/sheets for all charts

---

### 📊 4. **Chart Generation**

* Loop through all parameters
* Render line/bar charts for each
* Use `recharts` (recommended) or `chart.js`
* Let user scroll through them or group by month/section

✅ **Goal**: You should see all 60–70 parameter charts visually

---

### 🔍 5. **Chart Controls (Optional UI Enhancements)**

* Add filters/sorting:

  * Show specific parameters only
  * Group by sheet/month
  * Search parameter by name
* Use dropdowns, toggles, or search bars

✅ **Goal**: Make the dashboard more usable for real exploration

---

### 🧾 6. **Download Charts as PDF**

* Wrap each chart in a `div` with `ref`
* Use `html2canvas` + `jspdf` to:

  * Convert chart `div`s into images
  * Generate multi-page PDF
  * Add download button: “Download All Charts”

✅ **Goal**: One click → full PDF report

---

### 🧠 7. **(Optional) Insights & Summary Panel**

* Calculate total, average, min/max for each parameter
* Show KPIs or highlights (e.g., "Highest Production Day", etc.)
* Use cards, badges, or sidebars

✅ **Goal**: Give instant value beyond just graphs

---

### 🧪 8. **Testing + Error Handling**

* Handle bad uploads (non-Excel, empty sheets, etc.)
* Show loading states while parsing
* Display fallback if data is missing or broken

✅ **Goal**: Robust UX even for non-tech-savvy users

---

### 🚀 9. **Packaging & Hosting**

* Optional but awesome: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
* Add favicon, loading animations, etc.
* Share the dashboard with stakeholders

## ✅ You're Ready!

Once you reach step 3 (cleaned JSON), you're at the **heart** of the project. Everything else builds naturally from there.

Want a **starter scaffold** next — or want to begin designing the UI layout first?
